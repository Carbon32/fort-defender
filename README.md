## About:

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/bkwacqx.png" width = 900 height = 700>

This is a Python Fort Defending video game, made in pure Python. The engine is able to handle a lot of tasks including: 

* Displaying sprites and updating them.
* Displaying an interactive background, supporting the day & night cycle.
* Displaying different animations (moving, death, attack...).
* Playing sounds and music.
* Displaying Interactive Buttons (repair, re-load, add towers...).
* Displaying a User Interface (Health, Ammunition and other stuff).
* Displaying & updating automatic towers (helps the player taking down enemy tanks).
* Displaying particles & different effects (including lighting, can be seen when you shoot a tank).
* Increasing the game level after 20 kills, making the game harder. 
* Displaying different types of enemies (including custom animations & health).
* And a few more minor features...

I made sure the engine is well optimized and all features are split into different classes.

Thanks to 'vnitti' for the background art. And also thanks to _Kassjak_ for the clouds art.
